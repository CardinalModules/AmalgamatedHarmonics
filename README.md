Welcome to the Amalgamated Harmonics; your one-stop shop for barely usable modules for [VCVRack](www.vcvrack.com).

We offer two modules 

* [Scale Quantizer](https://github.com/jhoar/AmalgamatedHarmonics/wiki/Scale-Quantizer)
* [Arpeggiator](https://github.com/jhoar/AmalgamatedHarmonics/wiki/Arpeggiator)

More modules are on their way.

The latest release is [0.5.3](https://github.com/jhoar/AmalgamatedHarmonics/releases/tag/v0.5.3)

### Notes

These modules are primarily intended as a vehicle for me to learn how to create modules for VCV Rack.   

After watching a cool video from KlirrFaktor, I set out to build a scale based quantiser as there did not seem to be one around and this was a great opportuntity to learn how to build modules. I did not spot jeremywen's module in development, but wasn't going to let redundancy get in the way of good idea. I thought I'd at least add something (scale degree-based gates) that may or may not be usedful for someone.  

ScaleQuantiser: Input/Output from Rack, Lights system, UI design and how to align SVG with UI elements defined in the code (screenshots, transparency and object proxies). 
Arpeggiator: Working with clocks (in progress)
